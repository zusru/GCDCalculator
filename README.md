# GCDCalculator
This Java program calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm. It repeatedly subtracts the smaller number from the larger number until both numbers are equal, which is the GCD. Then it prints the GCD of the original two numbers entered by the user.
